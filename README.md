# Pic without MPLABX

The goal is to see how far I can go with PIC development without MPLAB X.

MPLAB X is a good tool, but I've been using VScode for many years now, and I've got used to it, and it is hard for me to use something else now.
After a quick search, I haven't find any suitable solution for my problem so let dig into the feasibility of my idea.

## existing solution:

platform IO is a plugin for VScode that allows embedded development for many platforms but not the PIC33, and is it more a hobbyist tool than a professional solution.

## POC:
  - compile a project with xc16 compiler
  - program a target
  - debug a target
  - include a build tool
  - include a TDD solution
